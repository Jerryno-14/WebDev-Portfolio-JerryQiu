In the process of completing this web development, I learnt some experiences and knowledge about web development through practical actions, and also encountered quite a lot of some challenges. What follows is my reflection and summary of my web development process.
Firstly, as my first attempt at web development, I started from zero and learnt the most basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge points as well as basic code structure through Microsoft's online courses. At the same time as the weak course learning, I started the process of trying to develop web pages at the same time. When developing web pages, I always encountered knowledge points other than those in the Microsoft course, such as adjusting the position of various text boxes, and at such times, I could only solve the problems by consulting online resources and combining with AI-assisted teaching and so on. Through consulting online resources and interacting with AI, I gradually mastered how to build the structure of a web page, design styles and add simple interactive functions.
Secondly, the design of the webpage was inspired by the official website of my favourite basketball team, and I tried to combine a simple layout with personalised elements. For example, in the homepage, I used a split-column layout to display my background information and project content, while enhancing the visual effect through the combination of images and text. In the design of the navigation bar, I focused on the user experience, ensuring that links were clear and easy to access. In addition, I added an accessibility toolbar to the webpage, including voice reading and speech rate adjustment features to enhance the accessibility of the webpage. During the development process, I encountered some technical difficulties. For example, when initially implementing a responsive layout for images, the size and scale of the images did not fit perfectly, which was later solved by adjusting CSS properties (e.g. border-radius). In addition, the JavaScript voice-reading function took a lot of time to debug, especially the implementation of the speech rate control, which was finally completed through AI-assisted interaction and repeated testing.
Finally, although the webpage has implemented the basic functions, there are still many areas that can be improved. For example, the current styling is rather simple, and more animation effects or more complex interactive features could be introduced in the future. In addition, the web page's accessibility features could be further optimised, such as adding high contrast mode and keyboard navigation support. I also plan to learn more front-end frameworks to improve the development efficiency and dynamics of web pages.
